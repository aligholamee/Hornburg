The Battle of the **Hornburg**, also known as Battle of Helm's Deep, was the first grand-scale battle of the War of the Ring where the Rohirrim under King Theoden defended the Hornburg from Saruman's army of Uruk-hai.

## Machine Learning Viewpoint
We all know that machine learning was present even before 1980 (When the louie-louie brothers began to shine!), But the practical usage and the capacity of the machines didn’t let the machine learning to shine those days. Though we cannot forget the IBM’s amazing progress with the assistance of Arthur Samuel – the founder of machine learning in IBM’s machines – and the great results on the blue brain computer and other artificial heroes of this field, the most drastic bottleneck of machine learning was its implementation and the practical usage in industries and other world evolving technologies like social networks, cyber security, product sales and other awake computer categories in the world. My overall viewpoint of machine learning is the integration of two quotes by Geoffrey Hinton and Linus Torvalds.
